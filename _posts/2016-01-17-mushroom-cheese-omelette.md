# Method

Omelettes are hard to get right. A perfect omelette has to be soft and fluffy
but not runny, cooked completely but not browned or burnt. This post outlines
my way of making omelettes. It's essentially the same as what you'll find on
tons of videos and recipes online, but with one technique that I use to
consistently get the temperature of the skillet right.

First, cook the mushrooms. Slice them up and toss them in the skillet along with
the olive oil and some salt and pepper. Keep the heat low as you don't want to
burn them and keep stirring them. When the water starts to evaporate out, add
the vinegar. I stop cooking the mushrooms when they look like this:

Transfer the mushrooms on a plate and keep them aside. Crack the eggs in a bowl,
add salt and pepper and beat the eggs until the egg white and the yolk
mix completely. Grate the cheese and keep it handy.

Now comes the tricky part. In order to get the perfect omelette you need to
cook the eggs completely without burning them. The way I achieve this
is by using a thick bottomed skillet and heating it up to the same
temperature every time I make an omelet. Turn up the heat and set it to low
and let it heat up the skillet until it reaches a steady state temperature.
The skillet should be hot enough that once you drop in the butter it should
start sizzling, but not so hot that it burns. You will have to experiment
with your cooking unit to find the heat setting that works for you.

Once the skillet reaches a steady state temperature, switch off the heating,
pour in the eggs and stir them around for a few seconds. It takes about
half a minute to cook the omelette. Quickly transfer in the cheese and
mushrooms.

Keep the omelette in the skillet until the top of the cooks. Since the heat is
turned off, the bottom of the omellette will not burn. When you find that the
bottom of the omelette can be dislodged using a spatula, fold the omelette
on itself. Tilt the skillet and slide the omelette out on a plate.
